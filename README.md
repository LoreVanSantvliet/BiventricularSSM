# Biventricular statistical shape model

This repository is associated with the paper "Integrating anatomy and electrophysiology in the healthy human heart: Insights from biventricular statistical shape analysis using universal coordinates". It contains code to generate synthetic biventricular surface meshes from a statistical shape model (SSM).

This repository is accompanied by the following [Zenodo repository](doi:10.5281/zenodo.14261122), containing the biventricular SSM itself, and a synthetic cohort of 100 biventricular, volumetric meshes, including fiber orientation and anatomical tags for LV and RV endo- and epicardium, and LV septum.

Additional inquiries about data and code availability can be directed to Lore Van Santvliet (lore.vansantvliet@kuleuven.be).
